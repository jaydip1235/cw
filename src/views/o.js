      "Summary":"The case of Reshmu and Ors. v. Rajinder Singh and Ors. involves a dispute over land ownership and possession. The original plaintiff, Suram Singh, filed a suit for pre-emption of a land sale and sought a declaration of ownership and permanent injunction against the defendants. The dispute arose from the sale of land by Bassia to Harnam Singh, Munshi Ram, and Tilak Chand in 1940, which Suram Singh sought to pre-empt. The trial court held that the plaintiff was the owner of the land, despite the possession being with the defendants without any title. The High Court, on appeal, found that the plaintiff was the owner in possession of the land and restrained the defendants from interfering with the ownership and possession. This decision was based on the fact that the pre-emption amount was deposited by the plaintiff, and the title to the land passed to the plaintiff from that date, even though no actual possession was obtained. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal filed by the defendants, upholding the decision of the High Court. This case highlights the significance of the pre-emption decree and the accrual of title to the decree-holder, even in the absence of actual possession, in determining land ownership rights.",

        "Summary":"In the case of Appeal (crl.) 89 of 2005, the appellant, Mathai, challenged the judgment that convicted him under Section 326 of the Indian Penal Code for causing grievous hurt to the victim. The appellant's argument was based on the contention that the injuries sustained by the victim did not constitute grievous hurt and that the weapon used was not dangerous. However, the court upheld the conviction, emphasizing that the victim's injuries were examined by a doctor and found to be grievous. Additionally, the court considered the nature of the weapon used, a stone, and concluded that it could indeed cause serious harm. The judgment, delivered by ARIJIT PASAYAT & S.H. KAPADIA, ultimately disposed of the appeal, affirming the appellant's conviction under Section 326 of the Indian Penal Code.",

        "Summary":"The case of SATYA NARAYAN SHARMA Vs. STATE OF RAJASTHAN involves an appeal against the dismissal of a criminal miscellaneous petition under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code for quashing an order passed by a Special Judge under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The appellant had managed to delay the trial for 7 years by obtaining a stay through a miscellaneous petition. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, directing the trial to be taken up on a day-to-day basis and concluded within 6 months. Additionally, the Court directed the Registrars of all High Courts to list cases where stays have been granted under the Prevention of Corruption Act, despite a specific bar against it, for appropriate action. This case highlights the issue of delays in trials under the Prevention of Corruption Act and the need to address such delays to combat corruption among public servants effectively.",
